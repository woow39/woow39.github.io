    <h2>Enemy/Block Coin Amounts</h2>
    <p>This list will be styled like this, Goomba 1, 1. This first number means how many stomps it takes to get the reward. Anything after is the coin amount or reward. So it's something like this, stomps, reward.</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>Paragoomba = 1, 1</li>
        <li>Monty Mole = 1, 1</li>
        <li>Piranha Plant = 1, 10</li>

        <li>Moving Platforms = 1, Get coins by moving Mario/Luigi</li>
        <li>Time Block = 1, get 30 seconds</li>
        <li>Custom Time Block = 1, get 10, 15, 30 secs, or lose time</li>

        <li>Pipe x2 = 1, start timer with 60 sec or get 15 sec</li>

        <li>Blue toad = 2, 8</li>
        <li>Pink Yoshi = 1, the next 3 1 hit enemies give you 3 coins</li>
    </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="powerup">
    <h2>Power Up Packs</h2>
    <p>Power up packs are cool. They change the way Lego Mario/Luigi plays. I'm actually only missing one of them. Here they are.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fire Mario/Luigi</li>
        <li>Cat Mario/Luigi</li>
        <li>Builder Mario/Luigi</li>
        <li>Propeler Mario/Luigi</li>
        <li>Bee Mario/Luigi</li>
        <li>Penguin Mario/Luigi</li>
        <li>Tanooki Mario/Luigi </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now i will tell you what each of them do. The fire Mario suit allows you to flick Lego Mario to get coins, like he's shooting a fire ball.<br> The cat Mario suit allows Lego Mario to climb up walls for coins. The builder Mario suit allows Lego Mario to stomp for coins.<br> Next is the propeller Mario suit which allows you to jump with Lego Mario then shake him side to side for coins. <br>Now we have bee Mario. You jump then move him around in the air for coins. <br>Penguin Mario: Belly slide around for coins. <br>Last but not least we have Tanooki Mario. tilt him side to side for coins. this will also subtract 1 hit from enemies everytime you shake.</p>

    <h2>The Sets</h2>

    <p>I will now review each set except the power up sets</p>
    <h3>Adventures with Mario Starter Set Review</h3>
    <p>This set is one of the ones that you need to start your adventures with Lego Mario. It's one of the <em>only</em> set that comes with the Lego Mario figure, the course's start and the course's end.<br> The enemies included are, a Goomba and Bowser Jr.. It also comes with a ? block.<br> so overall this is a pretty cool set. It retails for about $70 in Canada</p>

    <h3>Whomp's Lava Trouble Set Review</h3>
    <p>This set is pretty small, but it does have more pieces than the desert pokey set, even though they both cost the same, about $25 in Canada.<br> This set has mostly lava (A.K.A. red) pieces for its ground pieces. There are only two enemies in this set. They are a Lava Bubble and a Whomp. It also has a P block. This set is pretty basic but cool.</p>
    <h4>Whomp's Lava Trouble Pictures</h4>
    <img src="2020-10-07 07.26.20.jpg" alt="This is a Lego Whomp" width="100">

    <img src="2020-10-07 07.24.08.jpg" alt="This is a Lego P block" width="100">
    <h3>Desert Pokey Set Review</h3>
    <p>Even though this set is smaller than the Whomp's Lava Trouble set, I like it more. The reason being the hammer platform thing you use to knock the Pokey segments down is really cool. You use it to knock over four Pokey segments, then step on one of them. It also comes with a Monty Mole. That is why this set is also really cool.</p>
    <h4>Desert Pokey Pictures</h4>
    <img src="2020-10-07 07.25.13.jpg" alt="This is a Lego Pokey" width="100">
    <img src="2020-10-07 07.27.51.jpg" alt="This is a Lego Monty Mole" width="100">
    <h3>Guarded Fortress Set Review</h3>
    <p>This was my favorite Lego Mario set that I have. The reason I like it so much is because of the contraptions.<br> The first one is the Piranha Plant contraption. You jump on some sort of lever thing and it pushes the Piranha Plant into the pipe, and the barcode block pops up.<br>The second contraption is the flagpole thing. You jump on a plate and the flagpole pops up. the final contraption is the fortress. You jump on the Pow Block and the fortress door opens. You can also get coins from the door.<br> This set also comes with a Bob-omb and a Koopa Troopa. Overall this set is really cool and retails for about $70 in Canada.</p>
    <h4>Guarded Fortress Pictures</h4>

    <h3>Pirhana Plant Power Slide Set Review</h3>
    <p>yYou know what? This set is pretty fun to play with. That's because it comes with this slide thing where you have to balance Mario by tilting the slide. <br>That's not the olny thing it comes with though. It also comes with a Koopa, a timer block and a goomba. <br>Overall I really like this set. Mostly because it's the most fun to play with.</p>
    <h4>Pirhana Plant Power Slide Pictures</h4>
            <h3>Master Your Adventure Set Review</h3>
            <p>This set is pretty cool. It comes with a bunch of ground pieces. it also comes with larry, a goomba, a bob-omb, 2 custom ? blocks, and a custom Timer Block. <br>You can change what you get from the custom blocks using a contraption that comes with the set. Overall it's a pretty good set. it just lacks a bit of substance. It costs around $25 in canada </p>
            <h4>Master Your Adventure Pictures</h4>
            <h3>Reznor Knockdown Set Review</h3>
            <p>This set is my new favorite. The contraptions are great. it comes with 2 reznors, grolll, and a blue toad. It also comes with a skewer that you use to knockdown the reznors. <br>to line up the reznors you spin this thing, which feels really satisfying. like it's so clicky! This set is expensive, (around $100 in canada,) but it's still great. 10/10 in my opinion  </p>
            <h4>Reznor Knockdown Pictures</h4>
            <h3>Fuzzy and Mushroom Platform Pack Set Review</h3>
            <p>There's not much to say except, that it comes with a fuzzy and a star block. that's about it. Nice</p>
            <h4>Fuzzy and Mushroom Platform Pack Pictures</h4>
            <h3>Adventures with Luigi Starter Set Review</h3>
            <p>This set is one of the ones that you need to start your adventures with Lego Mario. It's one of the <em>only</em> set that comes with the Lego Mario figure, the course's start and the course's end.<br> The enemies include are, a bone goomba, pink yoshi, and boom boom. The set is pretty nice. It also comes with luigi instead of Mario. You don't need both to play btw. i just happen to have both. Anyway this set costs around $70 in canada. nice/10</p>
            <h4>Adventures with Luigi Starter Set Pictures</h4>
    <h3>My 4 Enemy Packs</h3>.
    <p>Enemy packs are blind bags with a random enemy inside. the two enemies I got were 2 Eep Cheeps, a huckit crab, and a Paragoomba. Here they are.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Overall I really like this. It's really cool. It is pretty expensive, but I would definitely recomend it.<br> You actually don't need the Lego Mario figure to build the sets, so you could use the sets you like for display. BYE!</p>
